Very long story short, we do four things:

1. Set up VPC infrastructure to hold our containers
    - VPC
    - Subnets
    - Cluster

2. Register a docker container (our app) with ECR to be copied into our infrastructure later
    - Provision our IDE environment with the right tools to build our app and container
    - Build the thing
    - Register with ECR

3. Set up a NLB to route traffic to containers on our infrastructure
    - Create an NLB
    - Create a Target Group
    - Create a listener to take traffic hitting a specific NLB port and send it to our docker containers tagged with the Target Group

4. Set up an ECS service to create and tag our containers and provision our infrastructure with them
    - Create a Task that defines how our containers should be run
    - Create a service that defines:
        - WHAT container to create (via the task definition)
        - WHERE to create the container (our infrastructure)
        - WHO is going to be looking for it (via our NLB and Target Group)

...so at the end of the day our infrastructure HOSTS our containers, our ECS service PROVISIONS our infrastructure with our containers, 
and NLB ROUTES TRAFFIC to our infrastructure.

Fargate's job is to handle the creation of EC2 instances on our cluster to run our containers.  That's a lot of work and we don't want to do it.
